            <p class="answer">
              Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document. They are used
              for things like SEO, defining character sets, and viewport
              settings.

              Load balancing is a technique to distribute incoming network
              traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes
              overwhelmed.

              Scope refers to the current context of code, which determines the
              accessibility of variables. JavaScript has global, function, and
              block scopes.

              JavaScript is a programming language, while jQuery is a library
              that simplifies JavaScript operations, especially DOM manipulation
              and event handling.

            <p class="answer">
              HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. The key difference is that
              HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure data in transit, while
              HTTP sends data in plain text.

              CSS preprocessors like Sass, Less, and Stylus extend CSS with
              features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions, which are
              compiled into regular CSS.

              Responsive web design is an approach where websites adapt to

              The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for
              HTML and XML documents that represents the page structure as nodes

              AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for creating

              REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style

            <p class="answer">
              Version control is a system that records changes to files over
              time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. Git is the
              most widely used version control system.

              SQL databases are relational with structured schemas (MySQL,
              PostgreSQL), while NoSQL databases are non-relational with
              flexible schemas (MongoDB, Cassandra), better suited for
              unstructured data.
